# About me
My name is Javier :wave:, and my nickname is **@maverick** :man_pilot: :airplane: and the contribution to the places where I work with a transformational approach are collaboration, proactivity, and the resolution of complex problems, based mainly on agile thinking :muscle:

My role today is lead and share with a technical team in the Infrastructure area :technologist:, with Cloud :cloud: orientation in Multi-Cloud :cloud::cloud: approach with the aim of taking our legacy to the cloud, and mounting new solutions on it.

We are not only migrating to Cloud, but also making improvements in our processes, such as Ansible-based automation, the use of Containers based on Kubernetes, and the use of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, but more than technology, the change more Difficult is the change of Mindset :brain:, of which I feel proud today to contribute in my team :rowboat:.

I consider in my career that no challenge based on technology is impossible to do, wanting is power, and learning is part of my culture, knowing how to say I don't know, and building collaboratively.
