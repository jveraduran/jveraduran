# About me
My name is Javier :wave:, and my nickname is **@maverick** :man_pilot: :airplane: and the contribution to the places where I work with a transformational approach are collaboration, proactivity, and the resolution of complex problems, based mainly on agile thinking. :muscle:

My role today is lead and share with a technical team in the Infrastructure area :technologist:, with Cloud :cloud: orientation in Multi-Cloud :cloud::cloud: approach with the aim of taking our legacy to the cloud, and mounting new solutions on it.

I consider in my career that no challenge based on technology is impossible to do, wanting is power, and learning is part of my culture, knowing how to say I don't know, and building collaboratively.
